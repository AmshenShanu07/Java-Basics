# Oops With Java
Hello World, I am a python and a javascript developer,

I started my coding life by learnnig Python first, At that time I was not intrested in the leacture so i skipped the basics of Oops now i am struggling with that, So recommend to learn the basic will,

So i desiced to learn the basic of Oops, I took java because it is the most core language and 3 billion devices on the earth is runnig with java, So I started Oops by learning the basics of java, I started learnning from a malayalam YouTube channel named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Crossroadstalk">Crossroads</a> the mentor Nikhil Kilivayil is a great teacher and youth icon for next generation programmers, Their videos are well explained and well taken, Their have condected a campain named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmEYRhyusU&list=PLY-ecO2csVHeKaBI7lAM1jbIPU8K6fUxY">100k Coding Challange</a> to support the youth to build their programming skills

## Java Basics
Java is a Object Oriented Programming and  a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

I have some basic HelloWorld, Conditional and some exercises programs on this repo

## Oops Basics
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself.

## Classes
In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword. 

If we take a real world exmple, We will make multiple Soaps with Soap mold, We Can use that soaps for different perposes, But we can't use the Soap mold for any perpose other than making soaps. In this example we can consider Soap mold as a Class and Objects as a soap, So the Soap is a exact blue printof Soap mold As the Object is a exact blueprint of Class
You can get an example of Class and Obect in Classes folder

## Constructor
In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.

In words its some action that should perform when we create a object, You can see a Programm in a folder named Constructor

## Inheritance 
Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

Its like giving some of the talents of parents to their childern
The if we extent a Sub Class to a base class we can use all the function in Sub class and Base class in an Objected created using the Sub class. You can checkout the folder Inheritance

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. Polymorphism is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface for several different underlying data types.

Its like using same name for method's which can perform differnt tasks, I will tell you more about this in subTopics

### Overloading
Java, like many other object-oriented programming languages, allows you to implement multiple methods within the same class that use the same name but a different set of parameters. That is called method overloading and represents a static form of polymorphism

This will help you to name different methods in class same name, and the difference is that in the arguments, if you named two methods one is with argument and other is without argument same name, and call the fuction without passing the argument it will call the function without argument, Its little tough to explain you can see the Overloading.java in Polymorphism folder run it and see the magic

### Overriding
In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. Method overriding is one of the way by which java achieve Run Time Polymorphism

Its a way of calling the main class from sub classed, In some cases there will be same named function with different actions So OverRiding helps us to call the functions of base class from sub class using a keyword super

### Overriding Constructor
